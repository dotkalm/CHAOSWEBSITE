# Chaos Agency — Next.js App

Scaffolded Next.js (app router) + TypeScript + MUI project.

Notes:
- The project uses `nodeLinker: node-modules` in `.yarnrc.yml`.
- MUI theme lives in `src/theme.ts` and a client provider is in `src/providers/MuiProvider.tsx`.
- Design reference: `reference/design.pdf` — adjust `src/theme.ts` typography values accordingly.
- Assets/favicons are expected in `public/favicons` — replace placeholders with your files from `/Users/joelholmberg/webapps/chaosAgency/assets`.
